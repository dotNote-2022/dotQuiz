 * <p>A class that represents the logic core of the round type "Boiling point" of the original
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz!:_Quiz_World">Buzz!: Quiz World</a> game. At least two players are
 * needed for this round.</p>
 *
 * <p>The class extends the <code>PointBuilderRoundLogic</code> class, extending its functionality, in order to
 * comply with the following round rules.</p>
 *
 * <p>The player(s) are asked questions until one of them reaches 5 correct answers. The player is rewarded with 5000
 * points, while the other players gain no credit points. In case there are more than one players that reach the
 * winning zone (5 correct answers) simultaneously, those players keep answering question until one of them reaches
 * higher score than the other ones. Only the players involved in draw keep playing, whilst the others are no longer
 * alive in the round (they can compete regularly in the next round).</p>
