 * At least two players are needed for this round. The round is timed.
 * The class extends the <code>StopTheClockRoundLogic</code> class, extending its functionality, in order to
 * comply with the following round rules.</p>
 * <p>The player(s) are asked a number of questions (5) and earn credit points on correct answer. The amount of credit
 * points is defined by the order of answering. The first player to answer the question correctly gets 1000 credit

 * even if they have answered correctly</p>
 * <p>There is no point penalty on wrong answer.</p>
