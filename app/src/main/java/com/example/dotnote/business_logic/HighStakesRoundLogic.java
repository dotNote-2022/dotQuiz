/**
 * <p>A class that represents the logic core of the round type "High Stakes" of the original
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz!:_Quiz_World">Buzz!: Quiz World</a> game.
 * The class extends the <code>PointBuilderRoundLogic</code> class, extending its functionality, in order to
 * comply with the following round rules.</p>
 * <p>The player(s) are asked a number of questions (5), earn credit points on correct answer and lose
 * credit points on wrong answer. For every question in the round, the players are, firstly, let to know
 * the category of the question and are asked to place a bet. The available bets are [250, 500, 750, 1000]  points.</p>
 * <p>After the bet placement, the question itself, as well as the available answers are revealed to the player(s).
 * Every player that answers correctly gets double its bet back. That means the final credit points are the points
 * before betting plus the amount of the bet.</p>
 * <p>However, in case a player answers the question wrong, loses its bet. That means the final points are
 * calculated by subtracting the amount of bet from the previously owned credit points. </p>
