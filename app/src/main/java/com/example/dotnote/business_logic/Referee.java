/**
 * <p>A class that represents a "referee" object in our game. The referee plays conducive role in the communication
 * between the model (round logic classes) and the view (round viewer classes). </p>
 * <p>The referee class could be described as a data storage class. The object stores data concerning the answers
 * given by players (who answered and what is their answer) as well as the time stamps associated (time elapsed on
 * answer).</p>
 * <p>In action, a referee object is responsible for communicating with the back-end of the game, and, especially,
 * the question-managing related tasks. The round viewer classes (front-end) use the referee object as a data storage
 * on which they "write" the answering data of players, based on the players' interaction with GUI.</p>
 * <p>On the other hand, the round logic classes (back-end) use the referee object as a Read-only storage item, from
 * which they read the answering data provided by the front end, in order to give the appropriate credits to players.
 * </p>
 * <p>Special attention is needed when using the above functionalities in combination. It is absolutely important that
 * the read-only methods of the <code>Referee</code> object are invoked only when data writing has been successfully
 * completed by the front-end. Otherwise, the referee can contain "garbage", unfinished or no data at all.</p>
