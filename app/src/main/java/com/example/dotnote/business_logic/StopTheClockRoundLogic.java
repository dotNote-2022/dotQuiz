 * <p>A class that represents the logic core of the round type "Stop the Clock" of the original

 * At least two players are needed for this round.
 * The class extends the <code>PointBuilderRoundLogic</code> class, extending its functionality, in order to
 * comply with the following round rules.</p>
 * <p>The player(s) are asked a number of questions (5) and earn credit points on correct answer. The round is timed
 * and the player(s) have 5 seconds to answer the question. In case of a correct answer, the players are rewarded with
 * as many points as the time remaining (in milliseconds - when they answered) times 0.2. That means if a player
 * answers correctly a question, and at the time of answering were 2.5 seconds remaining, they will be rewarded with
 * 2500 (millis)*0.2 = 500 points</p>
 * <p>There is no point penalty on wrong answer</p>
